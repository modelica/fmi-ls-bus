== Network Abstraction ("low cut") [[network-abstraction]]
This chapter describes the network abstraction or "low cut" in detail.

=== Overview
The network abstraction allows the implementation of virtual bus drivers within FMUs on the level of the hardware abstraction layer.
Exchanging data in terms of the <<low-cut-layered-standard-bus-protocol, Layered Standard Bus Protocol>> via variables grouped by a dedicated bus terminal (see <<low-cut-variables>>), allows the implementation of bus simulations in a wide range from idealized up to detailed behavior, including e.g., timing, arbitration, error, status and other effects.
During simulation, the network communication is controlled by send and receive Bus Operations.
Based on these operations, FMUs implementing this layered standard have to react depending on their role as specified in this document.
This role can be a Bus Simulation FMU or an importer with bus simulation support on one side, and Network FMUs (e.g., virtual ECUs) on the other side (see <<common-concepts-system-compositions, System Compositions>>).
To allow importers an easy distinction between these FMU roles, for Bus Simulation FMUs the attribute `isBusSimulationFMU` shall be set to `true` in the Manifest file.

In general, the Layered Standard Bus Protocol is bus-type-specific, but there are some similarities among different bus types.
Bus communication often follows a `Transmit`/`Confirm` pattern, where a Network FMU sends a `Transmit` operation containing the network message as payload.
Depending on the <<common-concepts-system-compositions, System Composition>>, the importer forwards the `Transmit` operation either directly to receiving FMUs or to a dedicated bus simulation.
The Bus Simulation then might delay the transfer of the `Transmit` operation to the receiving FMUs to simulate timing behavior, before sending a bus-specific `Confirm` operation back to the sending FMU.

The point in time at which FMUs will (potentially) send new network messages can be given to the importer in advance with the proper Clock type.
Based on these times, the importer has to calculate the next `communicationStepSize` for all networked FMUs.
For simulating bus communication with timing effects, the FMUs should set the Co-Simulation attribute `canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize = "true"`.

.Example for network simulation with timing behavior.
[#figure-transmission-example-with-timing-behavior]
image::bus_simulation_example.svg[width=80%, align="center"]

For simplification reasons or if a detailed bus simulation is not desired, fixed-step size FMUs can also be used with network abstraction.
However, depending on the chosen simulation step-size, delay effects of the bus simulation have to be taken into account.
Compositions with fixed-step size and variable-step size FMUs require the decoupling of the Bus Simulation logic and the Bus Simulation timing.
This decoupling is realized by queuing Tx/Rx Bus Operations inside the Bus Simulation as well as queuing Tx Bus Operations inside Network FMUs.
By queuing Bus Operations, System Compositions with variable-step size FMUs as well as fixed-step size FMUs can be simulated together without affecting each other.

=== Layered Standard Bus Protocol [[low-cut-layered-standard-bus-protocol]]
The Layered Standard Bus Protocol allows the transmission of Bus Operations between FMUs in binary form via Clocks and clocked variables (see <<low-cut-variables>>).
Depending on the role (Network or Bus Simulation), FMUs have to respond to received operations as specified by this layered standard.
Operations and the reaction on receipt are bus-type-specific and therefore described in the bus-specific chapters.
However, the description follows a uniform structure and consists of two parts, an overview table and a detailed description of all operations.

The overview table represents the binary format of operations and is structured as follows:

* OP Code: The operation code defines the unique value of the operation.
It consists of one byte in length.
* Length: A four byte total data length (OP Code + Length + Arguments) field following the OP Code.[[TotalLengthField]]
For operation with variable size arguments, the total length can vary in value at runtime.
* Arguments: The arguments of the respective operation.
The number of arguments is defined for each operation within this standard.
For arguments with a variable length, an argument pair composed of length and data is used.

The following table shows an example of an operation definition.
The name is _OperationName_ and has the OP Code 0x01.
The operation has three arguments _Arg1_ (2 bytes long), _Arg2_Length_ (1 byte long), _Arg2_Data_ (_<Arg2Length>_ bytes long), whereby argument 2 and argument 3 form a coherent variable length argument.

Remarks:

* Numbers shall be transmitted with `little-endian` byte order.
* Since the standard allows to concatenate multiple operations (see <<low-cut-tx-rx-data-variables, Tx/Rx Data Variables>>), the <<TotalLengthField, Length>> field is introduced to allow the implementation of a generic parser for received operations.

==== Format Error [[low-cut-format-error-operation]]

=== Variables [[low-cut-variables, Variables]]
This section explains how layered standard bus protocol operations are sent and received by FMUs using FMI 3.0 Clock and clocked variables footnote:[For details, refer to Functional Mock-up Interface Specification (fmi-standard.org) chapter 2.2.8 Clocks.].
While the former (see <<low-cut-tx-clock-variables, Tx Clock Variables>> and <<low-cut-rx-clock-variables, Rx Clock Variables>>) are used for scheduling and time synchronization, the latter (see <<low-cut-tx-rx-data-variables, Tx/Rx Data Variables>>) are used to carry the layered standard bus protocol operations in binary form.
To summarize, four variables with the following characteristics and relations are used:

* The `Rx_Data` variable is clocked by the `Rx_Clock` variable, both with `causality` set to `input`.
* The `Tx_Data` variable is clocked by the `Tx_Clock` variable.
The `causality` for the `Tx_Data` variable shall be `output`, but for the `Tx_Clock` variable it depends on the selected Clock type (see <<low-cut-tx-time-based-clock-variables, Tx Clock Variables>>).

Both variable pairs must be listed as member of its corresponding <<low-cut-bus-terminal, Bus Terminal>>.

==== Tx Clock Variables [[low-cut-tx-clock-variables]]
As described in the FMI 3.0 specification, Clock variables are used to synchronize events between importer and across FMUs.
Since Clock variables are strictly related to the `Event Mode`, networked FMUs shall set the Co-Simulation attribute `hasEventMode = "true"` in the model description file.

The point in time where Bus Operations are transferred from the `Tx_Data` to the `Rx_Data` variables is defined by the `Tx_Clock` variable.
This point is also referred to as the Bus Communication Point.
A Bus Communication Point and a regular communication point can take place at the same time, but should be considered as independent by the importer.
In contrast to a regular communication point where input/output variables used in step mode are exchanged, only the clocked Tx/Rx data variables needs to be considered by the importer.

For defining the point in time of a Bus Communication Point, `time-based` or `triggered` Clocks can be used for the `Tx_Clock` variable.
Hence the Clock type can influence the bus simulation significantly - the differences should be taken into account.

===== Time-based Tx Clock Variables [[low-cut-tx-time-based-clock-variables]]
A `time-based` `Tx_Clock` variable allows networked FMUs to announce a Bus Communication Point for the next simulation step in advance.

.Example Bus Communication Points announced by aperiodic time-based Tx_Clock variables.
[#low-cut-communication-points]
image::low_cut_communication_points.svg[width=100%, align="center"]

The announced Tx time however does not mean that a Bus Operation really has to be transferred, but that the connected networked FMUs should enter the `Event Mode` at that time.
An importer has to determine proper communication step sizes to synchronize networked FMUs at the announced Tx time.

_[Note: While simulation it can happen that no `Tx_Data` has to be transferred to the `Rx_Data` variable at the announced Tx time. In this case the returned 'valueSize' of the `Tx_Data` variable is 0.]_

Although the `causality` of a `time-based` `Tx_Clock` variable and a `triggered` `Rx_Clock` variable are each `input`, it is allowed to connect both, since a `time-based` Clock variable of an FMU is considered only to be a request to the importer to provide an attendant Clock source.

.Consideration of time-base Tx_Clock connections.
[#low-cut-time-based-port-connection]
image::low_cut_time_based_port_connection.svg[width=50%, align="center"]

Because of the common Clock source however, both Clock variables (Rx/Tx) might get active at the same time.
To make sure that the `Rx_Data` variables is set properly, an importer has to activate the `Rx_Clock` variable under consideration of `Tx_Data` and `Rx_Data` dependency.

_[Note: For clarity always a direct connection line between the `Tx_Clock` and `Rx_Clock` variables is shown in figures of this document.]_

A `time-based` Clock can be `periodic` or `aperiodic`.
Both allows to define Bus Communication Points independently from the regular communication points with fixed or variable distances.
The difference between the two Clock types is listed in the following table.

.Time-based Clock properties.

[cols="3,1,7"]
|====
h|Clock properties h|intervalVariability h|Description
|`periodic`|`constant`|The Bus Communication Point interval is defined in the `modelDescription.xml`.
|`periodic`|`fixed`|The Bus Communication Point interval is defined in the `modelDescription.xml` or must be provided in `Initialization Mode`.
|`periodic`|`tunable`|The Bus Communication Point interval is defined in the `modelDescription.xml` or must be provided in `Initialization Mode` and can be changed in `Event Mode`.
|`aperiodic`|`changing`|The Bus Communication Point interval must be provided in `Initialization Mode` and can be changed in `Event Mode` if this Clock ticked.
|`aperiodic`|`countdown`|The Bus Communication Point interval must be provided in `Initialization Mode` and can be changed in every `Event Mode`.
|====

Network FMUs using a `time-based` `Tx_Clock` variable should set the Co-Simulation attribute `canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize = "true"` in the model description file, since `fmi3DoStep` is typically called with variable `communicationStepSize`.

===== Triggered Tx Clock Variables [[low-cut-tx-triggered-clock-variables]]
A `triggered` Clock basically allows to signal events when returning from `fmi3DoStep` either by using an `Early Return` or when the requested communication point at latexmath:[t_{i+1}] was reached.
Since signaling `Tx_Clock` events with an early return at latexmath:[t < t_{i+1}] would require to set connected networked FMUs back in time to reach Bus Communication Points synchronously, a `triggered` `Tx_Clock` variable must only be set when returning from `fmi3DoStep` with the `earlyReturn` argument set to `fmi3False`.
In consequence, Bus Communication Points and regular communication points coincide and take place at the same time.
The time of a Bus Communication Point can therefore not be defined independently, but is given by the importer.
Pending Tx data shall be signaled by returning from `fmi3DoStep` with the `eventHandlingNeeded` arguments set to `fmi3True`.

[#low-cut-triggered-port-connection]
image::low_cut_communication_with_triggered_tx_clock.svg[width=100%, align="center"]


==== Rx Clock Variables [[low-cut-rx-clock-variables]]
The input Clocks (`Rx_Clock`) shall be `triggered` Clocks.

==== Tx/Rx Data Variables [[low-cut-tx-rx-data-variables, Communication Variables]]
The Tx/Rx variables are of type `fmi3Binary` and contain multiple Bus Operations, as sent or receive by the FMU.
If no Bus Operations shall be sent by a specified Network FMU at a given Bus Communication Point, the size of the corresponding binary `Tx_Data` variable shall be set to zero.
The senders can choose how many Bus Operations are buffered and/or for how long operations are buffered before activating an output Clock to trigger the actual sending of these operations.
This allows senders to trade accuracy for speed: buffering more and interrupting the simulation less will lead to faster simulations, but less accurate timing of the network communication.

==== Selecting the type of Tx Clock[[low-cut-selecting-tx-variables]]
Selecting suitable Tx variables allows the FMU (or better the exporting tool) to balance the accuracy and performance of its network communication:

 - While `aperiodic` Clocks allow very accurate network simulations, frequently entering `Event Mode` will reduce the network simulation speed.
 - Using `periodic` Clocks and queueing the operations to be transmitted reduces the number of `Event Mode` entries and speeds up the simulation at the cost of simulation accuracy.
 - One could use (structural) parameters to define the accuracy of `aperiodic` Clocks, allowing control of the simulation accuracy and performance with the same FMU.

==== MIME Types
Within FMI, every binary FMI variable has a `mimeType`, which indicates the type of data passed as a binary.
This type indicates which specific bus type is involved.
It ensures that only bus types of the same type can be interconnected, since FMI only allows the connection of two MIME types of the same binary variables.
The following table lists the names of MIME types used for the Tx/Rx data variables:

.Overview of the available MIME types for the supported several bus types.
[#table-mime-types]
[cols="4,5",options="header"]
|====
|MIME type
|Description

|org.fmi-standard.fmi-ls-bus.v1.can
|Binary variables simulating the automotive CAN network including CAN, CAN FD and CAN XL

|org.fmi-standard.fmi-ls-bus.v1.lin

|Binary variables simulating the automotive Ethernet network

|org.fmi-standard.fmi-ls-bus.v1.spi
|Binary variables simulating the automotive SPI network

|====

As in the table, above the version of a specified bus type is integrated within the MIME type.
The MIME type and the associated versioning ensure that only compatible bus types can be connected to each other.
The version number marks the set of available operations.
Only the major version is included by the specified MIME type.
The versioning follows the rules of semantic versioning, as defined in <<PW13>>.

=== Terminal Definitions
This section defines terminals for network abstraction or "low cut".

==== Bus Terminal [[low-cut-bus-terminal,bus terminal]]
Each network connected to the FMU must be described in `icons/terminalsAndIcons.xml` as a `<Terminal>` element of `<fmiTerminalsAndIcons><Terminals>`.
The attribute `name` of the `<Terminal>` must match the name of the specified network _[e.g., the name of the CAN channel: Powertrain]_ within a "low cut".
If the specified FMU is connected to more than one network, there shall be exactly one `<Terminal>` for each network.

Attribute definitions::
 * `terminalKind` must be set to `org.fmi-ls-bus.network-terminal`.
 * `matchingRule` must be set to `org.fmi-ls-bus.transceiver`.
 * `name` is the network name, e.g., `Powertrain`, see <<low-cut-example, example>> and constraints.

Element definitions::
 * Every Bus Terminal contains exactly four variables each in the role of: `Tx_Data`, `Tx_Clock`, `Rx_Data` or `Rx_Clock`.
 * Variables in the role of `Rx_Data`, `Tx_Data`, `Rx_Clock` and `Tx_Clock` are exposed in the `modelDescription.xml` and must be listed as `<TerminalMemberVariable>` elements, whereby `variableName` can be freely chosen.
 * `<TerminalMemberVariable>.memberName` defines the role of the variable within the `<Terminal>` and shall be set to `Tx_Data`, `Tx_Clock`, `Rx_Data` or `Rx_Clock`.
 * There must be no `<TerminalStreamMemberVariable>` element.

The `matchingRule` of type `org.fmi-ls-bus.transceiver` is specified as: `Tx_{Data|Clock}` variables shall be connected to `Rx_{Data|Clock}` variables and vice versa, whereby the variable type shall be equal.

The <<#figure-frame-variables-terminals-lowcut, following figure>> shows a FMU with four variables `Tx_Data`, `Tx_Clock`, `Rx_Data`, `Rx_Clock` that are aggregated to a `<Terminal>` named _Bus Terminal_:
