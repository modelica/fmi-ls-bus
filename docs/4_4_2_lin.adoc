==== LIN
This chapter describes the <<low-cut-layered-standard-bus-protocol, Layered Standard Bus Protocol>> for LIN.

===== Overview
To simulate LIN buses, LIN-specific operations are specified based on the <<low-cut-layered-standard-bus-protocol, Layered Standard Bus Protocol>>.
Overall, the following groups of operations exists:

* Transmit: This group of operations is used to simulate a frame transmission.
There are three specific operations that represent the different communication options between a LIN Master and one or more LIN Slaves.
* Error: This group of operations is used for protocol format errors and to simulate bus failures.
For example, the failure of a transmission can be indicated.
* Configuration: This operation enables the configuration of bus-specific parameters and options that are required to simulate the bus behavior properly.
For example, it allows the specification of the baud rate.
* Status: This operation is used by Networked FMUs to inform Bus Simulations about the internal state (Power Off/Initialization/Operation/Sleep) which concerns the reaction on bus errors.
* Wake up: LIN supports wake up and sleep scenarios.
Normally there are two ways to wake up from sleep mode: a local wake up on a specified wake-up pin, or a wake up on the LIN bus via a LIN specific wake-up pulse.
This operation is used to simulate triggering a wake up from bus side.

The following table gives a detailed overview of the available operations.
It shows all operations and the arguments they contain.

===== Operations
This section defines the allowed operations for LIN.
The following tables provides an overview of all operations and specifies the position and length of the corresponding arguments, as well as the respective flow direction.

====== Transmit [[low-cut-lin-transmit-operation]]
There are three types of transmit operations, each representing the transmission of a LIN header, a response and a combination of a header and response.

.Detailed description of the LIN Header operation.

[cols="5,4,3,20"]
|====
h|Name 3+| Header
h|Description 3+| Represents an operation for the transmission of a LIN header from a LIN Master to LIN slaves.
h|OP Code [hex] 3+| 0x10
.5+h|Content h|Argument h|Length h|Description
| OP Code | 1 byte | Contains the OP Code of the specified operation.
For this operation the OP Code always has the value 0x10.
| Length | 4 byte | Defines the cumulative length of all arguments in bytes.

3+|The Header operation shall be provided by Network FMUs to initiate the transmission of a LIN header.
In case of direct connected Network FMUs (see <<common-concepts-direct-communication>>), the FMU importer forwards the operation directly to the receiving Network FMUs.
If a Bus Simulation is involved (see <<common-concepts-composition-with-dedicated-bus-simulation-fmu>> and <<common-concepts-importer-with-integrated-bus-simulation>>), the FMU importer forwards the operation initially to the Bus Simulation, where the operation is distributed with respect to the simulated bus behavior.
Depending on the simulation details, the Bus Simulation might response with a <<low-cut-lin-bus-error-operation, Bus Error>> or <<low-cut-lin-format-error-operation, Format Error>> operation.

|====

===== Transmission and Reception
#TODO#

===== Detection of Collisions
#TODO#

===== Configuration of Bus Simulation
The configuration of the Bus Simulation is done by the Network FMUs itself.
For this purpose, the <<low-cut-lin-configuration-operation, Configuration operation>> provides several configuration parameters.
<<low-cut-lin-configuration-operation, Configuration operations>> can be produced multiple times during the runtime of a Network FMU.
Because the Bus Simulation shall choose a default behavior, it might be useful in several scenarios that Network FMUs finish configuration before the production of <<low-cut-lin-transmit-operation, Transmit operations>>.

====== Baudrate Handling
In order to calculate the time required for the transmission of a bus message, it is necessary to inform the Bus Simulation about the specified baud rate from a Network FMU.
This baud rate information can be configured by using `LIN_BAUDRATE` configuration kind of the <<low-cut-lin-configuration-operation, Configuration operation>>.
If the baud rate information is not adjusted by a specified Network FMU, the Bus Simulation shall choose a default behavior by itself.

====== Node Definition
By using the `LIN_NODE_DEFINITION` configuration kind of a <<low-cut-lin-configuration-operation, Configuration operation>>, the specified node type `LIN_MASTER` or `LIN_SLAVE` needs to be adjusted.
This configuration must be done before the first exchange of <<low-cut-lin-transmit-operation, Transmit operations>>.
A Bus Simulation should stop as soon as more than one LIN Master is configured in a network.

===== Error Handling
#TODO#

===== Wake Up/Sleep
This standard supports wake up and sleep for the LIN bus, whereby only the bus-specific parts are taken into account.
This means that the realization of local virtual ECU wake-up and sleeping processes are internal parts of the respective FMU, which is not covered by this document.
Because entering sleep state is a virtual ECU internal process always within LIN bus, this can be ignored.
Also, the virtual ECU local wake-up process is ignored as well.
The LIN-specific wake-up pulse can be simulated by using the <<low-cut-lin-wake-up-operation, Wakeup operation>>.
A <<low-cut-lin-wake-up-operation, Wakeup operation>> is initiated by one Network FMU and shall be distributed to all participants of the bus,except the wake-up initiator, by the Bus Simulation.

.Wake up initiated by FMU 1 wakes up FMU 2 and FMU 3 via bus.
