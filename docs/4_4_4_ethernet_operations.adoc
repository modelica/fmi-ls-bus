.11+h|Content h|Argument h|Length h|Description

| OP Code
| 4 bytes
| Type of the operation.

| Length
| 4 bytes
| Defines the cumulative length of all arguments in bytes.
The following applies for this operation: `Length = 26 + Data Length`.

| The start frame (SFD) or start mPacket (SMD) delimiter.
Always set to 0xD5 for ordinary Ethernet frames when not using preemption/fragmentation.

| Fragment Counter

| Fragment counter of the continuation mPacket.
Must be set to 0, if this is not a continuation mPacket.

| Last Fragment
| 1 byte
| Indicates whether this is the last fragment of a fragmented Ethernet frame.
Must be set to `TRUE` if this is a full Ethernet frame.
For specification the boolean values `TRUE` and `FALSE` (see <<table-boolean-value-kinds>>) shall be used.

| Destination Address
| 6 bytes
| The destination address of the frame.
Only applicable if this is a full Ethernet frame or the first fragment of an Ethernet frame.

| 2 bytes
| Indicates the type of Ethernet frame (Ethernet II) or frame length (802.3).

| Data Length
| 1 byte
| The length of the data of this Ethernet frame or mPacket.
Note that this does not correspond to a field in the Ethernet frame.

| n bytes
| The payload data of the Ethernet frame or mPacket.

h|Behavior
3+|The <<low-cut-ethernet-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation shall be provided by Network FMUs to initiate the transmission of an Ethernet frame.
In case of directly connected Network FMUs (see <<common-concepts-direct-communication>>), the FMU importer forwards the operation directly to the receiving Network FMUs.
If a Bus Simulation is involved (see <<common-concepts-composition-with-dedicated-bus-simulation-fmu>> and <<common-concepts-importer-with-integrated-bus-simulation>>), the FMU importer forwards the operation initially to the Bus Simulation, where the operation is distributed with respect to the simulated bus behavior.
Depending on the simulation details, the Bus Simulation might respond with a <<low-cut-ethernet-confirm-operation, `Confirm`>>, <<low-cut-ethernet-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> or <<low-cut-ethernet-format-error-operation, `Format Error`>> operation.

|====

====== Confirm [[low-cut-ethernet-confirm-operation]]
The <<low-cut-ethernet-confirm-operation, `Confirm`>> operation is used to indicate the successful transmission of an Ethernet frame by a Network FMU.

.Detailed description of the Confirm operation.

.3+h|Content h|Argument h|Length h|Description

| OP Code
| 4 bytes
| Type of the operation.

| Length
| 4 bytes
| Defines the cumulative length of all arguments in bytes.
The following applies for this operation: `Length = 8`.

h|Behavior
3+|This operation shall be produced by the Bus Simulation and consumed by Network FMUs. +
Only Network FMUs with the corresponding optionally exposed <<low-cut-ethernet-bus-notification-parameter, `BusNotifications`>> parameter set to `fmi3True` might wait for this operation.

|====

====== Format Error [[low-cut-ethernet-format-error-operation]]
Represents a format error that indicates a syntax or content error of receiving operations.
See <<low-cut-format-error-operation, `Format Error`>> for definition.

====== Bus Error [[low-cut-ethernet-bus-error-operation]]
The <<low-cut-ethernet-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operation is used to indicate a bus communication error.
Bus errors are delivered to every participant in the network.

.Detailed description of the Bus Error operation.

h|Description 3+| Indicates an error during the transmission of an Ethernet frame.
h|OP Code [hex] 3+| 0x30
.5+h|Content h|Argument h|Length h|Description

| OP Code
| 4 bytes
| Type of the operation.

| Length
| 4 bytes
| Defines the cumulative length of all arguments in bytes.
The following applies for this operation: `Length = 10`.

| Error Code
| 1 byte
| Represents the specified bus error to simulate.
See <<table-fmi3-ls-bus-ethernet-bus-error-code-values>> for possible values.

| Is Sender
| 1 byte
| Indicates whether this bus error occurs in response to a transmission of this FMU.

h|Behavior
3+|When transmitting Ethernet frames, various kinds of bus error may happen.
A Bus Simulation can simulate such errors by providing <<low-cut-ethernet-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operations to the Network FMUs.
Based on consumed <<low-cut-ethernet-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operations, Network FMUs can react on.
For a Network FMU that initiated the <<low-cut-ethernet-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation, the argument `Is Sender` shall be set to `TRUE` in the corresponding <<low-cut-ethernet-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operation.
The arguments `Is Sender = TRUE` must only be set once per simulated error. +
Only Network FMUs with the corresponding optionally exposed <<low-cut-ethernet-bus-notification-parameter, `BusNotifications`>> parameter set to `fmi3True` might wait for this operation and respond accordingly.
