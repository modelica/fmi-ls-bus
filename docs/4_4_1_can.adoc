==== CAN, CAN FD, CAN XL
This chapter describes the <<low-cut-layered-standard-bus-protocol, Layered Standard Bus Protocol>> for CAN, CAN FD and CAN XL.
The various CAN standards CAN, CAN FD and CAN XL are considered together, because they are very similar and can also be combined in certain scenarios.

===== Overview
To simulate CAN, CAN FD and CAN XL buses, CAN-specific operations are specified based on the <<low-cut-layered-standard-bus-protocol, Layered Standard Bus Protocol>>.
Overall, the following groups of operations exists:

* Transmit: This group of operations is used to simulate a frame transmission.
There are three specializations of this operation, one each for CAN, CAN FD and CAN XL frames.
* Confirm: An acknowledgment of transmitted CAN frames is defined by the CAN standard.
This kind of operation is used to simulate this behavior.
* Error: This group of operations is used for protocol format errors and to simulate bus failures.
For example, the failure of a transmission can be indicated.
* Arbitration Lost: The operation is used by Bus Simulations to inform Network FMUs that a frame could not be transmitted immediately.
* Configuration: This operation enables the configuration of bus-specific parameters and options that are required to simulate the bus behavior properly.
For example, it allows the specification of the baud rate or influencing the buffer behavior.
* Status: This operation is used by Networked FMUs to inform Bus Simulations about the internal state (Active/Passive/Bus-Off) which concerns the reaction on bus errors.
* Wake up: CAN supports wake up and sleep scenarios.
Normally there are two ways to wake up from sleep mode: a local wake up on a specified wake-up pin, or a wake up on the CAN bus via a CAN specific wake-up pulse.
This operation is used to simulate triggering a wake up from bus side.

The following table gives a detailed overview of the available operations.
It shows all operations and the arguments they contain.

If a Bus Simulation is involved (see <<common-concepts-composition-with-dedicated-bus-simulation-fmu>> and <<common-concepts-importer-with-integrated-bus-simulation>>), the FMU importer forwards the operation initially to the Bus Simulation, where the operation is distributed with respect to the simulated bus behavior.
Depending on the simulation details, the Bus Simulation might response with a <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, `Confirm`>>, <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>>, <<low-cut-can-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> or <<low-cut-can-format-error-operation, `Format Error`>> operation.

3+|The specified operation shall be produced by the Bus Simulation and consumed by Network FMUs.
If the structural parameter <<low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter, `org.fmi_standard.fmi_ls_bus.Can_BusNotifications`>> of a Network FMU is set to `false`, the Network FMU does not wait for any responses from a Bus Simulation, i.e., potentially received <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, `Confirm`>> operations are discarded by the Network FMU.

|Defines the cumulative length of all arguments in bytes.
The following applies for this operation: `Total Length = 9`.

|ID
|4 byte
|The ID of the CAN message which which could not be transmitted immediately, because it loses arbitration.

h|Behavior
3+|During simulation, several <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operations can be sent by Network FMUs to a Bus Simulation at the same time.
In such case, the Bus Simulation has to decide which <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation should be processed first.
Depending on the configuration (see the `Arbitration Lost Behavior` argument of the <<low-cut-can-configuration-operation, `Configuration`>> operation), the deferred <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operations shall either be buffered or they shall be discarded and the <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>> operation shall be sent back to the respective Network FMUs.
A Network FMU receiving the <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>> operation can decide to provide the <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation again or e.g., to raise an internal transmit timeout failure after a while.
If the structural parameter <<low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter, `org.fmi_standard.fmi_ls_bus.Can_BusNotifications`>> of a Network FMU is set to `false`, the Network FMU does not wait for any responses from a Bus Simulation, i.e., potentially received <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>> operations are discarded by the Network FMU.

|Set if the <<low-cut-can-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operation is a reaction to a <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation that was provided by the specified Network FMU from the Bus Simulation.
For specification the boolean values `TRUE` and `FALSE` (see <<table-boolean-value-kinds>>) shall be used.

h|Behavior
3+|While transmitting CAN frames, various kinds of bus error may happen.
A Bus Simulation can simulate such errors by providing <<low-cut-can-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operations to the Network FMUs.
Based on consumed <<low-cut-can-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operations, Network FMUs shall maintain an internal CAN node state (see <<low-cut-can-error-handling>>).
To determine the CAN node state properly, Network FMUs need the information about their role at the time when the simulated error happened.
For a Network FMU that initiated the <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation, the argument `Is Sender` shall be set to `TRUE` in the corresponding <<low-cut-can-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operation.
For a Network FMU considered to be the one detecting the error first, the argument `Error Flag = PRIMARY_ERROR_FLAG` shall be set.
The arguments `Is Sender = TRUE` and `Error Flag = PRIMARY_ERROR_FLAG` must only be set once per simulated error.
If the structural parameter <<low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter, `org.fmi_standard.fmi_ls_bus.Can_BusNotifications`>> of a Network FMU is set to `false`, the Network FMU does not wait for any responses from a Bus Simulation, i.e., potentially received <<low-cut-can-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operations are discarded by the Network FMU.

===== Network Parameters [[low-cut-can-network-parameters]]
Using structural parameters, FMUs can be parameterized according to importer specifications.
This chapter specifies the structural parameters that each CAN-specific Network FMU shall provide.

====== Bus Notification Parameter [[low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter]]
For a detailed simulation, the CAN bus behavior regarding acknowledgment, bus errors and arbitration losses must be considered.
A Bus Simulation can simulate these effects by sending bus notifications in terms of <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, `Confirm-`>>, <<low-cut-can-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error-`>> and <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>> operations to the Network FMUs.

However, in scenarios where Network FMUs are connected directly to each other, or where the Bus Simulation does not simulate such effects, it must be possible to configure the Network FMU such that it does not wait for any response after a <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation.
Therefore, the <<low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter, `org.fmi_standard.fmi_ls_bus.Can_BusNotifications`>> parameter is introduced.
If the value of the parameter is set to `false`, the Network FMU must not wait for any response after a <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation ("fire-and-forget").
The default value shall be `false` to allow the Network FMU to be run natively in each simulation scenario.
If the Network FMU shall be configured to handle responses in the form of <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, `Confirm-`>>, <<low-cut-can-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error-`>> and <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>> operations, the <<low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter, `org.fmi_standard.fmi_ls_bus.Can_BusNotifications`>> parameter shall be set to `true`. +
_[This does not necessarily mean the FMU must fully support CAN error handling or sophisticated arbitration mechanisms._
_A simple Network FMU might also choose to treat Bus Error or Arbitration operations in a simplified manner, e.g., by treating them as a positive confirmation.]_

This structural parameter is mandatory for Network FMUs.
A Bus Simulation (FMU) does not require this structural parameter.

===== Configuration of Bus Simulation
The configuration of the Bus Simulation is done by the Network FMUs itself.
For this purpose, the <<low-cut-can-configuration-operation, `Configuration`>> operation provides several configuration parameters.
<<low-cut-can-configuration-operation, `Configuration`>> operations can be produced multiple times during the runtime of a Network FMU.
Because the Bus Simulation shall choose a default behavior, it might be useful in several scenarios that Network FMUs finish configuration before the production of <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operations.

====== Baud Rate Handling
In order to calculate the time required for the transmission of a bus message, it is necessary to inform the Bus Simulation about the specified baud rate from a Network FMU.
This baud rate information can be configured by using `CAN_BAUDRATE`, `CAN_FD_BAUDRATE` and `CAN_XL_BAUDRATE` configuration kind of the <<low-cut-can-configuration-operation, `Configuration`>> operation.
In a CAN FD scenario, both the configuration for `CAN_BAUDRATE` and for `CAN_FD_BAUDRATE` shall be carried out.
The Bus Simulation can derive the required CAN, CAN FD or CAN XL controller type from the baud rate configurations a Network FMU carried out.
If the baud rate information is not adjusted by a specified Network FMU, the Bus Simulation shall choose a default behavior by itself.

====== Buffer Handling
By using the `ARBITRATION_LOST_BEHAVIOR` configuration kind of a <<low-cut-can-configuration-operation, `Configuration`>> operation, the buffer handling within the Bus Simulation can be adjusted.
Using buffer handling is required in arbitration scenarios only and will be described <<low-cut-can-arbitration, within this context>>.
If the buffering is not adjusted by a specified Network FMU, the Bus Simulation shall choose a default behavior by itself.

===== Transmission and Acknowledge
The <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation represents the sending of a CAN, CAN FD and CAN XL frame.
With appropriate options, relevant functionalities can be configured and used on a network abstraction level (e.g., Virtual CAN network ID for CAN XL or Bit Rate Switch for CAN FD).
In the real world, flawlessly transmitted CAN frames will be acknowledged by at least one receiver CAN node.
To simulate this behavior, the <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, `Confirm`>> operations are introduced.
In addition, the structural parameter <<low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter, `org.fmi_standard.fmi_ls_bus.Can_BusNotifications`>> is defined to support lightweight bus simulations and <<common-concepts-direct-communication, directly connected Network FMUs>>.

If <<low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter, `org.fmi_standard.fmi_ls_bus.Can_BusNotifications`>> is set to `false` (default), then Network FMUs must not rely on receiving <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, `Confirm`>> operations.
In this case, the bus simulation is idealized and takes place in a "fire-and-forget" manner.
If a specified Network FMU is depending on <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, `Confirm`>> operations and <<low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter, `org.fmi_standard.fmi_ls_bus.Can_BusNotifications`>> is set to `false`, the self confirmation shall be realized internally within the respective Network FMU. 

<<#figure-can-direct-communication>> illustrates this communication, whereby FMU 1 transmits network data to FMU 2.
Subsequently, FMU 1 self-confirms the transmission internally.

For a detailed simulation, the Bus Simulation has to support <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, `Confirm`>> operations.
In this case, the <<low-cut-can-bus-notification-parameter, `org.fmi_standard.fmi_ls_bus.Can_BusNotifications`>> parameter of the Network FMUs can be set to `true` as Network FMUs can rely on receiving <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, `Confirm`>> operations.

The following <<#figure-can-confirmation-with-bus-simulation-fmu>> illustrates the behavior, whereby FMU 1 transmits network data to FMU 2 via a Bus Simulation.

If all Network FMUs, except the one initiating the <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation, communicate the <<low-cut-can-status-operation, status>> `BUS_OFF`, the Bus Simulation shall not provide a <<low-cut-can-confirm-operation, confirmation>>.

The https://modelica.github.io/fmi-guides/main/ls-bus-guide/#low-cut-can-sequence-diagrams[FMI LS BUS Implementer’s Guide] contains an example of the possible transmission results and displays them in a diagram.

===== Error Handling [[low-cut-can-error-handling]]
The CAN protocol includes a sophisticated fault confinement mechanism to prevent malfunctioning within CAN nodes.
A Transmit Error Counter (TEC) and a Receive Error Counter (REC) represent a historical communication quality metric.
To maintain the TEC and REC values, <<low-cut-can-bus-error-operation, `Bus Error`>> operations shall be provided to all Network FMUs by the Bus Simulation.
The argument `Is Sender` shall be set to `TRUE` for the Network FMU the <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation originated from.
The argument `Error Flag` shall be set to `PRIMARY_ERROR_FLAG` if the Network FMU detects the transmission error.
If a Network FMU changes its current CAN node state, the <<low-cut-can-status-operation, `Status`>> operation shall be provided to the Bus Simulation.
When a Network FMU signals the `BUS_OFF` state to the Bus Simulation, it shall not provide any new <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operations in order to simulate a real Bus-Off behavior.

===== Arbitration [[low-cut-can-arbitration]]
Arbitration is an instrument of the CAN standard to resolve the conflict of the simultaneous sending of messages from several CAN nodes without a collision.
The arbitration is handled in the Bus Simulation and can be recognized by the fact that the Bus Simulation receives a <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation from several FMUs at the same time.
As soon as an arbitration is lost, an <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>> operation shall be returned to the respective sender within the next `Event Mode`.
As soon as an FMU receives an <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>> operation, it can independently repeat the corresponding <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation.

[#figure-can-arbitration]
image::can_arbitration.svg[width=70%, align="center"]

Within a <<low-cut-can-configuration-operation, `Configuration`>> operation, the `Arbitration Lost Behavior` argument can be specified.
Once this option is set to `BUFFER_AND_RETRANSMIT`, the Bus Simulation buffers the frame after losing arbitration and sends it as soon as possible.
In this case, it is not necessary for the Network FMU to re-send the respective frame and an <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>> operation shall not be returned to the specific Network FMU.
If the `Arbitration Lost Behavior` is set to `DISCARD_AND_NOTIFY`, the specified Network FMU is informed by an <<low-cut-can-arbitration-lost-operation, `Arbitration Lost`>> operation and needs to repeat the corresponding <<low-cut-can-transmit-operation, `Transmit`>> operation by itself.
Arbitration is available in communication architectures with Bus Simulation only, i.e., it is not available for <<common-concepts-direct-communication, directly connected Network FMUs>>.

In the case of arbitration, the Bus Simulation must also take the status of the respective Network FMU into account, which is communicated via a <<low-cut-can-status-operation, `Status`>> operation.
To simulate the behavior of the CAN Extra Suspend Transmission Time when a CAN node is in Error Passive state, the Bus Simulation shall prefer Network FMUs whose status is `ERROR_ACTIVE` (see <<table-can-status-values>>).

The https://modelica.github.io/fmi-guides/main/ls-bus-guide/#low-cut-can-sequence-diagrams[FMI LS BUS Implementer’s Guide] contains examples of the presented arbitration cases and visualizes them using sequence diagrams.

===== Wake Up/Sleep
This standard supports wake up and sleep functionality for the CAN bus.
However, the realization of local virtual ECU wake-up and sleeping processes, i.e., the transition to the sleep state as well as the virtual ECU local wake-up process, is considered internal to the FMU implementation.
Therefore, only the bus-related aspects are defined in this document.

The CAN-specific wake-up pulse can be simulated by using the <<low-cut-can-wake-up-operation, `Wakeup`>> operation, initiated by one Network FMU.
The Bus Simulation shall distribute this operation to all participants on the bus, excluding the wake-up initiator.

.Wake up initiated by FMU 1 wakes up FMU 2 and FMU 3 via bus.
